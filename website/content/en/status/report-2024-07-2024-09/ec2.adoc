=== FreeBSD on EC2

Contact: Colin Percival <cperciva@FreeBSD.org>

FreeBSD is available on both amd64 (Intel and AMD) and arm64 (Graviton) EC2 instances.

In the past quarter, a new "small" flavour of EC2 AMI has been added, without debug symbols, tests, 32-bit compatibility libraries, or the LLVM debugger, and without the Amazon SSM Agent pre-installed or the AWS CLI installed by default at first boot.

Build performance tests are now being performed weekly using the snapshot AMIs built by the release engineering team.
These tests revealed several performance regressions which have now been fixed; in particular a bug fix to the use of the EFI RNG in the boot loader produced a dramatic speedup on Graviton instances.
