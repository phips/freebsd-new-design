During this year's Summer of Code, I wrote a userspace UFS driver using FUSE and Rust.
The project was meant to ease the process of mounting FreeBSD UFS filesystems on other operating systems.
Up to this point, only read-only filesystem access has been implemented.
But as a bonus, fuse-ufs has the ability to mount filesystems with endianness different from the host's endianness.

I am currently working on splitting the project into a binary and library part, to make it easier to integrate it into other operating systems.
As part of this refactoring, an additional FUSE2 backend will be implemented, to be able to run it on OpenBSD.
Currently there is testing infrastructure for Linux and FreeBSD with OpenBSD coming in the future.
Although there is no CI for MacOS, a friend of mine tested it with MacFUSE and it works.

Once the big refactor is done, I will start concentrating on implementing write support.
Thanks to being bribed by mailto:fuz@FreeBSD.org[Robert Clausecker], I will also add soft-updates and mounting Sun's UFS in the future.

The driver can be installed using `cargo install fuse-ufs`, or (if on Arch Linux) using your favorite AUR helper.
Thanks to Robert Clausecker a port for FreeBSD exists in package:sysutils/fusefs-ufs[].

A big thanks to mailto:asomers@FreeBSD.org[Alan Somers] and mailto:mckusick@FreeBSD.org[Kirk McKusick] for mentoring me and thanks to Robert Clausecker for the FreeBSD port and suggesting this GSoC project to me in the first place.
Another thanks to Davids Paskevics for writing a fuzzer for me.
