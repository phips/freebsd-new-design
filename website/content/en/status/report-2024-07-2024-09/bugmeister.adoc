==== Charts and graphs

link:mailto:emaste@FreeBSDFoundation.org[Ed Maste from the FreeBSD Foundation] has expressed an interest in seeing useful charts and graphs added to Bugzilla.
The few that we have now are not very informative.
Many of the link:https://wiki.freebsd.org/Bugzilla/SearchQueries[interesting Bugzilla queries] for them have been documented, but the information there is really dense.

If you are interested in working on this task, contact Ed directly.

==== Bugzilla version upgrade

Recently, upstream Bugzilla has released 5.0.4.1, which is a minor bugfix release.
Preliminary work suggests that the update will be unobtrusive.
Work is continuing.

==== PR statistics

PRs continue to come in and get triaged.
Over the longer term, we are nearly at steady-state.

The number of PRs over the past quarter (and year) has fluctuated.
Vladimir Druzenko pointed out that the number dropped by around 200 during 2023Q4.
(We have not done the data analysis to find out why that was.)
However, slowly, the number has come back to where it was a year ago.
But we do seem to be closing incoming PRs more quickly these days.
For reference:

The overall number of PRs remains at slightly over 11,600.
We do have a lot of technical debt.

Bugmeister is also working towards restarting the link:https://wiki.freebsd.org/Bugathons[Bugathons].

==== Acknowledgements

Bugmeister would like to thank a number of people who have assisted with bugbusting, including new triagers Alexander Vereeken, Alexander Ziaee, and Frederick Lee.
