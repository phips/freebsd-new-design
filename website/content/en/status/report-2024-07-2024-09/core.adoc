  The following people were present: allanjude, dch, glebius, hrs, lwhsu, mat, olivier, rene

* Slides are available at link:https://wiki.freebsd.org/DevSummit/202409[]

* Core met with the FreeBSD Foundation to have their periodic meeting and take the change to do it in face-to-face.
  Topics included improving alignment and communications between the two groups and the community.

==== New support timeline for FreeBSD releases

* Core approves the proposal by re@ to reduce the support timeline for FreeBSD releases from five to four years, after which the release is supported on a best-effort basis.
  This proposal is also backed by portmgr and secteam.

==== srcmgr

* Core helped in forming a new srcmgr team.
  Their charter is not fully set in stone yet, it can be adjusted if needed in 6-12 months from now.
* Nominations for new src commit bits should from now on be sent to srcmgr@ instead of core@
* A lurker program is suggested to keep an influx of new members.
* Core announced srcmgr during DevSummit 202409 and sent a follow-up to developers@ on September 29.

==== Commit bits

* Core welcomes Igor Ostapenko (igoro) as a new src committer.

* Core extended the text that the grim reaper script sends to include ways on how to get commit bits of developers re-activated.
