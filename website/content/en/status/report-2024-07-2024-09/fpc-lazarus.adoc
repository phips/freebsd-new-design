Free Pascal is a mature, versatile, open source Pascal compiler.
It can target many operating systems and processor architectures: Intel x86 (16 and 32 bit), AMD64/x86-64, PowerPC, PowerPC64, SPARC, SPARC64, ARM, AArch64, MIPS, Motorola 68k, AVR, and the JVM.
Additionally, support for RISC-V (32/64), Xtensa, and Z80 architectures, and for the LLVM compiler infrastructure is available in the development version.
Also, the Free Pascal team maintains a transpiler for pascal to Javascript called pas2js.

Lazarus is a Delphi compatible cross-platform IDE for Rapid Application Development.
It has a variety of components ready for use and a graphical form designer to easily create complex graphical user interfaces.

Three years ago, Mikaël Urankar <mikael@FreeBSD.org> began porting the Free Pascal compiler to FreeBSD aarch64 and it was merged into Free Pascal source code (main branch).
Some months ago, I added package:lang/fpc-devel[] (3.3.1) and package:editors/lazarus-devel[] (3.99) to the ports tree only for i386 and amd64 because aarch64 was not ready yet.
The binaries generated on aarch64 did not run because of ELF issues.
Finally, some days ago the issues were resolved and support for FreeBSD aarch64 was completed.

package:lang/fpc-devel[] and package:editors/lazarus-devel[] were updated to 3.3.1.20240913 and 3.99.20240913 with support for aarch64 respectively.
It brings to FreeBSD users a new language and platform working on FreeBSD aarch64 for console, graphic, or any kind of apps development.

TODO

* Update package:fpc/lazarus[] based ports (such as package:sysutils/bhyvemgr[] and package:archivers/peazip[]) to support FreeBSD/aarch64
* Push FreeBSD RISC-V support
