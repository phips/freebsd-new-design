=== Capsicum and Bhyve Code Audit

With the support of the link:https://alpha-omega.dev/[Alpha-Omega project], the FreeBSD Foundation undertook code audits of two important subsystems -- the bhyve hypervisor, and the Capsicum sandboxing framework.
In addition to uncovering vulnerabilities in these systems to correct, the audits look to identify classes of vulnerabilities and/or suboptimal coding practices that we can look to address across the project.

The Foundation interviewed several firms, and selected Synacktiv to perform the audit.
A number of issues with critical and high severity were identified, which have been fixed as documented in security advisories:

Fixes are in progress for a number of lower-severity issues.
The code audit report will be shared in the near future, after issues above a severity threshold have been addressed.
The FreeBSD Foundation will also publish a report including commentary on the impact of the Synacktiv code audit report, classes of vulnerabilities identified, and lessons learned.
