Here is the second 2024 status report, with 20 entries.

It has been very difficult to publish this status report within the usual schedule: indeed we are late.
Unfortunately many of us have been busy with a lot of stuff, both inside and outside FreeBSD, thus some reports arrived late and report publication was slower than usual.
Hopefully, this quarter was an exception and next quarter we will already be back on track, with 2024Q3 report published within October 2024.

Have a nice read.

Lorenzo Salvadore, on behalf of the Status Team.
