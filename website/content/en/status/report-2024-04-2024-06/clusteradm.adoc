Contact: Cluster Administration Team <clusteradm@FreeBSD.org>

FreeBSD Cluster Administration Team members are responsible for managing the machines the Project relies on to synchronize its distributed work and communications.

In this quarter, the team has worked on the following:

* Regular support for FreeBSD.org user accounts.
* Regular disk and parts support (and replacement) for all physical hosts and mirrors.
* Cluster software refresh.
* Moving cluster services to Chicago.

==== Cluster software refresh

Except for the package builders and developer-facing ("dogfood") machines, the FreeBSD cluster mostly tracks stable/X branches.
This quarter, we started moving the stable/13 hosts to stable/14.

At the time of this writing, there are 133 physical machines in the cluster, 48 run current, and 64 have been upgraded to stable/14.
The remaining machines are slated for upgrading or decommissioning in the near future.
Of the 290 jails in the cluster, 206 run stable/14.

==== Moving cluster services to Chicago

Earlier this year, we started building up our new site in Chicago.
This quarter, we began decommissioning older machines in New Jersey and moving services to the newer machines in Chicago.
Our long-term goal is for Chicago to become our primary location.
This work will take several more months to complete.

New official mirrors are always welcome.
We have noted the benefits of hosting single mirrors at Internet Exchange Points globally, as evidenced by our existing mirrors in Australia, Brazil, and South Africa.
If you are affiliated with or know of any organizations willing to sponsor a single mirror server, please contact us.
We are particularly interested in locations on the United States West Coast and throughout Europe.
