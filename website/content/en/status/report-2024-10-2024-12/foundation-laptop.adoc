Contact: Ed Maste <emaste@FreeBSD.org> +
Contact: Alice Sowerby <alice@freebsdfoundation.org>

The project began in Q4 of 2024 and is funded by the FreeBSD Foundation and Quantum Leap Research.
It has a budget of $750,000, which will be used over one to two years.
The goal is to improve key features like WiFi, audio usability, suspend and resume functions, graphics, and Bluetooth.
The team will also create clear documentation and step-by-step guides to help people use the new features.

* The FreeBSD project started a community group called the link:https://wiki.freebsd.org/LaptopDesktopWorkingGroup["Laptop and Desktop Working Group" (LDWG)] to help people working on Laptop- and Desktop-related projects to connect and collaborate with others in the community working on similar efforts.
The group held its first monthly meeting in December 2024.
