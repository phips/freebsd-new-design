The Erlang runtime system, commonly known as the BEAM, provides a runtime that is used by a number of programming languages and applications in the FreeBSD ports collection.

In the final update for 2024, the Erlang ecosystem team has been busy:

* Regular updates to all Erlang/OTP releases, to stay current
* Elixir 1.18.1, Gleam 1.6.3, and RabbitMQ updates

Users of RabbitMQ need to update each quarter to avoid being stuck on an unsupported release of Erlang/OTP + RabbitMQ, without a supported migration path.

Note that as the upstream Erlang OTP team only commit to supporting the two latest major releases, more and more point updates are arriving for OTP26-27, but not for the older Erlang runtime releases, which are now unlikely to get security and bug fixes.

The Erlang team will be updating the default Erlang runtime to OTP26, to package:lang/erlang[], along with the usual dependencies and tooling.

Additional testing and community contributions are welcome; please reach out on the mailing list, especially if you are able to help testing of specific port updates.
