Wazuh is a free and open source platform used for threat prevention, detection, and response.
It is capable of protecting workloads across on-premises, virtualized, containerized, and cloud-based environments.

Wazuh solution consists of an endpoint security agent, deployed to the monitored systems, and a management server, which collects and analyzes data gathered by the agents.
Besides, Wazuh has been fully integrated with the Elastic Stack or OpenSearch Stack, providing a search engine and data visualization tool that allows users to navigate through their security alerts.

After a long break, ports has been updated to include Wazuh version 4.9.2.
This version of Wazuh uses Python 3.11 instead of 3.10, and it includes some new features:

* support to get ports info,
* support to get processes info,
* improved memory info,
* FreeBSD decoder and rule files, and
* link:https://github.com/alonsobsd/wazuh-freebsd[FreeBSD Security Configuration Assessment files] for 13.x, 14.x and 15-CURRENT.

Also, FreeBSD ports include a custom version of wazuh-dashboard-plugins for a better integration with FreeBSD.

Wazuh can easily be installed in a jail by following the link:https://github.com/AppJail-makejails/wazuh[Wazuh AppJail-Makejails] tutorial.

Anyone interested in helping with the project or interested in aarch64 device donation for testing/packaging is welcome.

Current version: 4.9.2
