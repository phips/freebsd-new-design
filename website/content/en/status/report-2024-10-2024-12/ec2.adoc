FreeBSD is available on both amd64 (Intel and AMD) and arm64 (Graviton) EC2 instances.

In the past quarter, first boot performance of ZFS AMIs has been significantly improved, e.g. from about 22 seconds to about 11 seconds for 15.0 "base" AMIs on amd64.
Graphs of boot performance over time are now being generated and published automatically; typical times are around 9-12 seconds for "base" and "small" AMIs and 14-18 seconds for "cloud-init" AMIs.

On Graviton systems, the EC2 "shutdown" and "reboot" operations now work as intended (starting with FreeBSD 14.2).
On Graviton systems, adding new devices (e.g. EBS volumes) while the system is running now works in HEAD and support is expected to be merged in time for FreeBSD 14.3.
