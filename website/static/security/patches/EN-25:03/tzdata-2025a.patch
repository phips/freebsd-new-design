 News for the tz database
 
+Release 2025a - 2025-01-15 10:47:24 -0800
+
+  Briefly:
+    Paraguay adopts permanent -03 starting spring 2024.
+    Improve pre-1991 data for the Philippines.
+    Etc/Unknown is now reserved.
+
+  Changes to future timestamps
+
+    Paraguay will stop changing its clocks after the spring-forward
+    transition on 2024-10-06, so it is now permanently at -03.
+    (Thanks to Heitor David Pinto and Even Scharning.)
+    This affects timestamps starting 2025-03-22, as well as the
+    obsolescent tm_isdst flags starting 2024-10-15.
+
+  Changes to past timestamps
+
+    Correct timestamps for the Philippines before 1900, and from 1937
+    through 1990.  (Thanks to P Chan for the heads-up and citations.)
+    This includes adjusting local mean time before 1899; fixing
+    transitions in September 1899, January 1937, and June 1954; adding
+    transitions in December 1941, November 1945, March and September
+    1977, and May and July 1990; and removing incorrect transitions in
+    March and September 1978.
+
+  Changes to data
+
+    Add zone1970.tab lines for the Concordia and Eyre Bird Observatory
+    research stations.  (Thanks to Derick Rethans and Jule Dabars.)
+
+  Changes to code
+
+    strftime %s now generates the correct numeric string even when the
+    represented number does not fit into time_t.  This is better than
+    generating the numeric equivalent of (time_t) -1, as strftime did
+    in TZDB releases 96a (when %s was introduced) through 2020a and in
+    releases 2022b through 2024b.  It is also better than failing and
+    returning 0, as strftime did in releases 2020b through 2022a.
+
+    strftime now outputs an invalid conversion specifier as-is,
+    instead of eliding the leading '%', which confused debugging.
+
+    An invalid TZ now generates the time zone abbreviation "-00", not
+    "UTC", to help the user see that an error has occurred.  (Thanks
+    to Arthur David Olson for suggesting a "wrong result".)
+
+    mktime and timeoff no longer incorrectly fail merely because a
+    struct tm component near INT_MIN or INT_MAX overflows when a
+    lower-order component carries into it.
+
+    TZNAME_MAXIMUM, the maximum number of bytes in a proleptic TZ
+    string's time zone abbreviation, now defaults to 254 not 255.
+    This helps reduce the size of internal state from 25480 to 21384
+    on common platforms.  This change should not be a problem, as
+    nobody uses such long "abbreviations" and the longstanding tzcode
+    maximum was 16 until release 2023a.  For those who prefer no
+    arbitrary limits, you can now specify TZNAME_MAXIMUM values up to
+    PTRDIFF_MAX, a limit forced by C anyway; formerly tzcode silently
+    misbehaved unless TZNAME_MAXIMUM was less than INT_MAX.
+
+    tzset and related functions no longer leak a file descriptor if
+    another thread forks or execs at about the same time and if the
+    platform has O_CLOFORK and O_CLOEXEC respectively.  Also, the
+    functions no longer let a TZif file become a controlling terminal.
+
+    'zdump -' now reads TZif data from /dev/stdin.
+    (From a question by Arthur David Olson.)
+
+  Changes to documentation
+
+    The name Etc/Unknown is now reserved: it will not be used by TZDB.
+    This is for compatibility with CLDR, which uses the string
+    "Etc/Unknown" for an unknown or invalid timezone.  (Thanks to
+    Justin Grant, Mark Davis, and Guy Harris.)
+
+    Cite Internet RFC 9636, which obsoletes RFC 8536 for TZif format.
