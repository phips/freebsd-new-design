For general information regarding FreeBSD Errata Notices and Security
Advisories, including descriptions of the fields above, security
branches, and the following sections, please visit
<URL:https://security.FreeBSD.org/>.

I.   Background

periodic(8) is run via cron(8) as root to perform periodic system functions to
be executed on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis.

II.  Problem Description

periodic(8) jobs are typically run in a context as the `root` user, but an
erratum in calendar(1) may clobber the login session of both cron(8) and
periodic(8) to a non-`root` user if the daily calendar job is enabled with
`daily_calendar_enable=YES`.

III. Impact

Mail sent after calendar(1) has run in the daily periodic run will have a
non-root sender on the envelope.  This includes security jobs as well as other
cron jobs that may be run after the daily job has concluded.

IV.  Workaround

No workaround is available.  Systems that have not explicitly enabled the daily
calendar job are not affected.

V.   Solution

Upgrade your system to a supported FreeBSD stable or release / security
branch (releng) dated after the correction date.

Perform one of the following:

1) To update your system via a binary patch:

Systems running a RELEASE version of FreeBSD on the amd64 or arm64 platforms,
or the i386 platform on FreeBSD 13, can be updated via the freebsd-update(8)
utility:

# freebsd-update fetch
# freebsd-update install

2) To update your system via a source code patch:

The following patches have been verified to apply to the applicable
FreeBSD release branches.

a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.

# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/EN-24:15/calendar.patch
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/EN-24:15/calendar.patch.asc
# gpg --verify calendar.patch.asc

b) Apply the patch.  Execute the following commands as root:

# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch

c) Recompile the operating system using buildworld and installworld as
described in <URL:https://www.FreeBSD.org/handbook/makeworld.html>.

Restart the applicable daemons, or reboot the system.

VI.  Correction details

This issue is corrected as of the corresponding Git commit hash in the
following stable and release branches:

Run the following command to see which files were modified by a
particular commit:

# git show --stat <commit hash>

Or visit the following URL, replacing NNNNNN with the hash:

<URL:https://cgit.freebsd.org/src/commit/?id=NNNNNN>

To determine the commit count in a working tree (for comparison against
nNNNNNN in the table above), run:

# git rev-list --count --first-parent HEAD
