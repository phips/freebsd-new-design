CVE Name:       CVE-2024-45289

For general information regarding FreeBSD Security Advisories,
including descriptions of the fields above, security branches, and the
following sections, please visit <URL:https://security.FreeBSD.org/>.

I.   Background

Fetch is utility used to retrieve file(s) from URL(s) specified on the command
line.  It supports a --crl option to specify a certificate revocation list
which contains peer certificates which have been revoked.

II.  Problem Description

The fetch(3) library uses environment variables for passing certain
information, including the revocation file pathname.  The environment variable
name used by fetch(1) to pass the filename to the library was incorrect, in
effect ignoring the option.

III. Impact

Fetch would still connect to a host presenting a certificate included in the
revocation file passed to the --crl option.

IV.  Workaround

The certificate revocation list file can be specified by the SSL_CRL_FILE
fetch(3) environment variable rather than using the --crl option to fetch(1).

V.   Solution

Upgrade your vulnerable system to a supported FreeBSD stable or
release / security branch (releng) dated after the correction date.

Perform one of the following:

1) To update your vulnerable system via a binary patch:

Systems running a RELEASE version of FreeBSD on the amd64 or arm64 platforms,
or the i386 platform on FreeBSD 13, can be updated via the freebsd-update(8)
utility:

# freebsd-update fetch
# freebsd-update install

2) To update your vulnerable system via a source code patch:

The following patches have been verified to apply to the applicable
FreeBSD release branches.

a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.

# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-24:19/fetch.patch
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-24:19/fetch.patch.asc
# gpg --verify fetch.patch.asc

b) Apply the patch.  Execute the following commands as root:

# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch

c) Recompile the operating system using buildworld and installworld as
described in <URL:https://www.FreeBSD.org/handbook/makeworld.html>.

VI.  Correction details

This issue is corrected as of the corresponding Git commit hash in the
following stable and release branches:

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------

Run the following command to see which files were modified by a
particular commit:

# git show --stat <commit hash>

Or visit the following URL, replacing NNNNNN with the hash:

<URL:https://cgit.freebsd.org/src/commit/?id=NNNNNN>

To determine the commit count in a working tree (for comparison against
nNNNNNN in the table above), run:

# git rev-list --count --first-parent HEAD
