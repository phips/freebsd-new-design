Topic:          Possible DoS in X.509 name checks in OpenSSL

Category:       contrib
Module:         openssl
Announced:      2024-09-03
Credits:        David Benjamin (Google)
Affects:        FreeBSD 14.x
Corrected:      2024-09-03 17:09:21 UTC (stable/14, 14.1-STABLE)
                2024-09-04 21:07:35 UTC (releng/14.1, 14.1-RELEASE-p4)

CVE Name:       CVE-2024-6119

For general information regarding FreeBSD Security Advisories,
including descriptions of the fields above, security branches, and the
following sections, please visit <URL:https://security.FreeBSD.org/>.

I.   Background

FreeBSD includes software from the OpenSSL Project.  The OpenSSL Project is a
collaborative effort to develop a robust, commercial-grade, full-featured
Open Source toolkit for the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol.  It is
also a general-purpose cryptography library.

II.  Problem Description

Applications performing certificate name checks (e.g., TLS clients checking
server certificates) may attempt to read an invalid memory address when
comparing the expected name with an otherName subject alternative name of an
X.509 certificate.

Basic certificate chain validation is not affected. The issue only occurs
when an application also specifies an expected DNS name, Email address or IP
address.

III. Impact

Applications affected by the problem may result in a termination, leading to
a denial of service.

IV.  Workaround

No workaround is available.

V.   Solution

Upgrade your vulnerable system to a supported FreeBSD stable or
release / security branch (releng) dated after the correction date.

Perform one of the following:

1) To update your vulnerable system via a binary patch:

Systems running a RELEASE version of FreeBSD on the amd64 or arm64 platforms,
or the i386 platform on FreeBSD 13, can be updated via the freebsd-update(8)
utility:

# freebsd-update fetch
# freebsd-update install

2) To update your vulnerable system via a source code patch:

The following patches have been verified to apply to the applicable
FreeBSD release branches.

a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.

# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-24:13/openssl.patch
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-24:13/openssl.patch.asc
# gpg --verify openssl.patch.asc

b) Apply the patch.  Execute the following commands as root:

# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch

c) Recompile the operating system using buildworld and installworld as
described in <URL:https://www.FreeBSD.org/handbook/makeworld.html>.

Restart all daemons that use the library, or reboot the system.

VI.  Correction details

This issue is corrected as of the corresponding Git commit hash in the
following stable and release branches:

Branch/path                             Hash                     Revision
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------
stable/14/                              5946b0c6cbc7    stable/14-n268645
releng/14.1/                            9a5a7c90d5e5  releng/14.1-n267703
releng/14.0/                            abd3a7939117  releng/14.0-n265440
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------

Run the following command to see which files were modified by a
particular commit:

# git show --stat <commit hash>

Or visit the following URL, replacing NNNNNN with the hash:

<URL:https://cgit.freebsd.org/src/commit/?id=NNNNNN>

To determine the commit count in a working tree (for comparison against
nNNNNNN in the table above), run:

# git rev-list --count --first-parent HEAD
