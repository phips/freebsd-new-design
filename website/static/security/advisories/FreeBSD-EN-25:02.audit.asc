Topic:          System call auditing disabled by DTrace

Category:       core
Module:         audit
Announced:      2025-01-29
Credits:        Joe Duin
Affects:        All supported versions of FreeBSD.

For general information regarding FreeBSD Errata Notices and Security
Advisories, including descriptions of the fields above, security
branches, and the following sections, please visit
<URL:https://security.FreeBSD.org/>.

I.   Background

The audit(4) facility allows a system administrator to audit
security-relevant events.  System calls are one such security-related
event, and the audit(4) facility will record whether the system call was
successful along with other important details.

II.  Problem Description

When userspace invokes a system call, the kernel routes the call through
a common function which optionally logs an audit record for the call.
This function also calls into DTrace to implement system call tracing.
When both system call auditing and DTrace system call tracing are
enabled at the same time, a logic error causes auditing to be silently
disabled.

III. Impact

A privileged user can inhibit system call audit logging by running a
DTrace script which uses the "syscall" provider.  Once the DTrace script
exits, system call auditing will resume without any intervention.

IV.  Workaround

No workaround is available.

V.   Solution

Upgrade your system to a supported FreeBSD stable or release / security
branch (releng) dated after the correction date and reboot.

Perform one of the following:

1) To update your system via a binary patch:

Systems running a RELEASE version of FreeBSD on the amd64 or arm64 platforms,
or the i386 platform on FreeBSD 13, can be updated via the freebsd-update(8)
utility:

# freebsd-update fetch
# freebsd-update install
# shutdown -r +10min "Rebooting for a security update"

2) To update your system via a source code patch:

The following patches have been verified to apply to the applicable
FreeBSD release branches.

a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.

# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/EN-25:02/audit.patch
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/EN-25:02/audit.patch.asc
# gpg --verify audit.patch.asc

b) Apply the patch.  Execute the following commands as root:

# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch

c) Recompile your kernel as described in
<URL:https://www.FreeBSD.org/handbook/kernelconfig.html> and reboot the
system.

VI.  Correction details

Run the following command to see which files were modified by a
particular commit:

# git show --stat <commit hash>

Or visit the following URL, replacing NNNNNN with the hash:

<URL:https://cgit.freebsd.org/src/commit/?id=NNNNNN>

To determine the commit count in a working tree (for comparison against
nNNNNNN in the table above), run:

# git rev-list --count --first-parent HEAD
